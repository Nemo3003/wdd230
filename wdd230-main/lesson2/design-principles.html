                    I think Neil Patel's website is effectively utilizing the Visual Hierarchy principle of design.
                    The headline which contains the hook is more prominent than any other elements in the site. Below 
                    the headline is a few lines of paragraph that supports the headline. Then a big button with
                    a nice contrast of white on dark orange. The site also uses spacing very well to group contents
                    that are related. You can see how there are plenty of spaces between the headline group and the 
                    text field and button. Lastly, on the far bottom, another statment that says swipe up which is has plenty of white spaces
                    yet still noticeable because of the choice of color for the word "swipe up".

                    I think the Fitt's Law is somehow related to Visual Hierarchy. But this principle deals more with the distance
                    between the user and the target element. Fitt's Law stated that the shorter the distance between the user and the 
                    target and the larger the target, the more chances of that target to get clicked. The closer example I could find 
                    is the Walgreen's website. The design is kind of noisy and busy due to some elements that are competing for my
                    attention. But on the flip side, the important elements are in close proximity with my line of sight. The search bar
                    is there, the select a store field is there, the cart is there, the list of store nearby is there. They're all in one
                    place minimizing the need to travel away from the page.

                <div class="principles">
                    <h3>RULE OF THIRDS</h3>
                </div>

                    The Rule of Thirds principle is the same as the Rule of Thirds in art where you'll draw a grid overlay and position
                    the elements on the upper-left down to bottom-left, goes up to the right and down to botton-right. It's pretty hard
                    to find an example for this one because almost every website uses this principle on desktop view but changes when switched to
                    mobile views. I found Soulful Vibes Co's banner consistent with the Rule of Thirds even on mobile browser. Here, there is
                    that heading on the banner that says who they are on the very sweet spot of the grid. And then a picture of what seems like
                    a dried herb that summons spirits. The use of the Rule of Thirds on this one is not too accurate but it's the closest I could find.
